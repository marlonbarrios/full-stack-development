The cryptocurrency ecosystem is vast, fast growing and can be daunting and disorienting. lovethycrypto is a MERN app that offers the users a stream of the main 250 cryptocurrencies sorted by Market Cap. After logged in, the user is able to select a set of currencies to a personal list with links to a currency page with more information and external links to global news and Youtube searches about the showcased currency. All data is updated dynamically; app was deployed using Google Firebase authentication and consumes a third party API.

I created this image centric web/mobile porfolio for the videographer Daniel Van Note. He wanted a very elegant and minimalistic protfolio website with a will feature the rich imnagery of his commercial and artistic work. I developed a site modifying the Gatsby/React.js 'Starter Portfolio: Jodie' code and content managed in Markdown.
